# bubble_sort_visualiser
A simple graphical explanation of how Bubble Sort works written in C++ <br><br>
It is written in C++ but uses some Windows-specific commands, but it can be easily ported to Unix compatible systems.<br>
The code was compiled by GCC via MinGW. (Yay, free software!) <br>
Also, the IDE that I used was CodeBlocks because it is not only simple and fast to use, but also because I am a huge fan of free and open-source software. (another "Yay")<br>
The code is a bit messy right now, but I will comment it so it becomes easy to understand. <br><br>
If you have any suggestions and/or questions, don't hesitate to ask!
